### TLDR: [Try It Out Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_qUuVGWzRzGBU7qquv0-biY-Esv3Yj89?usp=sharing) ðŸ“’

## The Problem

Earlier this year, I discovered [that this Ruby integration](https://dev.to/kojix2/ruby-kernel-in-google-colaboratory-32ni) with [Google Colab](https://colab.google) had broken [due to an Ubuntu OS upgrade from 20.04 to 22.04](https://gist.github.com/ngoto/61459a11652826416d8f3ff9360f27c2?permalink_comment_id=4686866#gistcomment-4686866). While the [iruby gem](https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby) provided support previously, I wanted to see if there was another way to execute ruby code in Google Colab.


## The Solution: IPython Magic

With the help of Claude 3.5, I created a custom IPython magic command that lets you execute Ruby code directly in your Google Colab notebooks. Here's what it looks like in action:

```python
%%ruby
def hello(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

hello("Rubyist")
```

### Understanding IPython Magics

IPython (an interactive shell for Python with enhanced features) extends the Python language and has commands called [IPython Magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html). A "magic" or "magic command" is a special command prefixed with `%` (line magic) or `%%` (cell magic) that provides functionality beyond regular Python code.

In Google Colab as well as Jupyter notebooks, cells are areas where multiple lines of code are executed. Line magic (one `%`) applies to a single line, while cell magic (two `%%`) affects all lines in the cell.

### How Does It Work?

While Google Colab normally only executes Python code (since it's running an IPython kernel), we can use IPython Magics to extend its functionality. We register a cell magic function in Python that takes any text following `%%ruby` and executes it using IRB (Interactive Ruby):

```python
@register_cell_magic
def ruby(line, cell):
    if 'reset' in line:
        ruby_session.reset()
        print("Ruby session reset")
        return
    try:
        stdout, stderr_content = ruby_session.execute(cell)
        if stdout:
            print(stdout, end='')
        elif not stderr_content:
            print("Code executed successfully with no output.")
        if stderr_content:
            print(stderr_content, file=stderr, end='')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error executing Ruby code: {e}", file=stderr)
```

Using @register_cell_magic, we register a new magic command that processes Ruby code blocks, making Ruby available alongside Python in our notebook.

## The Complete Implementation

Here's the full script that enables Ruby execution in Google Colab. To use it simply copy and paste it into a Google Colab cell and run it!:

```python
from IPython.core.magic import register_cell_magic
import subprocess
import os
import re
from sys import stderr
import shutil
import atexit

class RubySession:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the Ruby session and ensure Ruby is installed."""
        self.code_history = []
        
        # Install Ruby if not present
        try:
            subprocess.run(['which', 'ruby'], check=True, capture_output=True)
            print("Ruby is already installed")
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
            print("Ruby is not installed, attempting to install...")
            if shutil.which('apt-get'):
                subprocess.run(['apt-get', 'update', '-y'], check=True)
                subprocess.run(['apt-get', 'install', '-y', 'ruby-full'], check=True)
                print("Ruby installation complete")
            else:
                print("Error: Cannot install Ruby automatically. Please install Ruby manually.")
                raise EnvironmentError("Ruby not found and automatic installation failed.")
                    
    def is_definition(self, code):
        """Check if the code contains definitions to be stored."""
        return bool(re.match(r'\s*(\w+\s*=|def\s|class\s)', code))
                    
    def execute(self, code):
        """Execute Ruby code within the session."""
        try:
            full_code = """
begin
  # Previous code
  {}
  # New code
  {}
rescue => e
  puts "Error: #{{e.class}} - #{{e.message}}"
  puts e.backtrace
end
""".format('\n  '.join(self.code_history), code)
            result = subprocess.run(['ruby'], 
                                    input=full_code, 
                                    capture_output=True, 
                                    text=True)
            if result.returncode == 0 and self.is_definition(code):
                self.code_history.append(code)
            return result.stdout, result.stderr
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            return '', f"Subprocess error: {e}"
        except Exception as e:
            return '', f"Unexpected error: {e}"
            
    def cleanup(self):
        """Clean up temporary files."""
        pass
        
    def reset(self):
        """Reset the session by clearing code history."""
        self.code_history = []

# Create global session
ruby_session = RubySession()

@register_cell_magic
def ruby(line, cell):
    if 'reset' in line:
        ruby_session.reset()
        print("Ruby session reset")
        return
    try:
        stdout, stderr_content = ruby_session.execute(cell)
        if stdout:
            print(stdout, end='')
        elif not stderr_content:
            print("Code executed successfully with no output.")
        if stderr_content:
            print(stderr_content, file=stderr, end='')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error executing Ruby code: {e}", file=stderr)

# Register magic function and cleanup
get_ipython().register_magic_function(ruby, magic_kind='cell')
atexit.register(ruby_session.cleanup)

print("Ruby magic command ready! Use %%ruby to run Ruby code.")
print("Example:")
print("%%ruby")
print("puts 'Hello from Ruby!'")
print("\nTo reset the Ruby session, use:")
print("%%ruby reset")
print("Note: Be cautious when executing code that modifies the session state.")
```

## How to Use Ruby in Google Colab

### Getting started is simple:

1. Open a Google Colab notebook
2. Copy and paste the script above into a cell and run it
3. Test it with a simple Ruby command:
   ```ruby
   %%ruby
   puts 'Hello, World!'
   ```

That's all it takes to start running Ruby code in Google Colab!

## Future Development

While this solution works well for immediate needs, there's still room for investigation into [why the built-in IPython Ruby magic isn't working despite being referenced in the documentation](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/b65cf89c05b4edb4a32b72e0c0e1b888020ee70f/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Cell%20Magics.ipynb#L38). One thing I noticed is that the IPython version in Google Colab isn't the latest and maybe the ruby magic command isn't implemented in earlier versions of the IPython source.
