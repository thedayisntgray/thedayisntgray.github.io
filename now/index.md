Here are my main priorities right now.
- Running an AI Consultancy (Building RAG apps, AI Agents and helping companies with AI strategy)
- Volunteering with Ruby Central helping meetup organizers.
- Spending time with friends and family.

This is page is mostly for my benefit. It's a perpetual reminder to be mindful of one of my most valuable resources...Time. 

There are so many interesting things I can get into and it's helpful for me to remember how the decisions I'm making relate back to what I'm trying to do.

This also helps you because if you send me a message and it relates to one of the above priorities you're more likely to get a quicker response from me.

I'm learning to [love saying NO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpqwwonLxds). Thanks Glenn!
