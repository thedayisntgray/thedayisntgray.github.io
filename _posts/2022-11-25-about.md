Hey I’m Landon Gray,

I’m a software engineer and consultant working at Test Double. I enjoy reading, learning new things and contemplating existence among other things.

This blog is a living work in progress and it is an attempt to both own my own piece of the web and consolidate the information I am learning into a tangible artifact that I and others can learn from.
