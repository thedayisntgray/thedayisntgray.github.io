# Building Strategic AI Solutions
Hey üëãüèæ,
My name is Landon, and I'm the founder of Identus Consulting. I help teams turn big ideas into real products. I specialize in using Ruby; however, I can also support organizations in various languages, tools, or ecosystems to create smart, scalable, and effective AI-driven applications and solutions. 
My focus is on developing MVPs and leading strategic initiatives that align with your business goals and propel you forward swiftly. Whether you're building a new MVP, needing help managing a recently launched project, or seeking to streamline existing operations, I'm here to build powerful solutions that grow with you.
